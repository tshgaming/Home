<h1 align=center>Should Teens Be Allowed To Drive ? </h1>

<br>
<br>

<p align=center> In Germany, teenagers are only allowed to drive at 17, under the supervision of an adult, and at 18 without supervision. In the USA, the legal driving age is 16, though some states allow teens as young as 14 and a half to drive while others have it as high as 18 and a half. </p>

<h2 align=center> Public Transport </h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>Even if teenagers are not allowed to drive they should at least have full access to public transport but that is not the case here. Not all teenagers have full access to public transport and not all parent can take care of their child’s pick and drop every day. This is how it is better if the driving age is not increased.

<h2 align=center> How Not increasing the Driving Age Helps The Parents </h2>

<br>
<br>

<p> Sure, in the beginning the teens will need supervision from an adult or their parents, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t drive by themselves. Once they learn how to drive without any supervision (which usually takes only a few months) they can drive on the main road alone. This can help the teenager’s parents in a lot of ways because some 16 year olds have a job so they go to school and then go to their jobs and their parents have to do the pick and drop but if teenagers are allowed to drive then that changes everything. </p>

<h2 align=center> Are 16 Year Old Drivers Mature Enough ? </h2>

<br>
<br>

<p> 16 year old drivers can drive safely if their parents just talk to them about it and tell them about how serious you have to be about driving to drive on the road. If their parents support their child then the child will listen and understand about the safety rules of driving. This will help the teen drive much more safely. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 align=center> So Should Teens Be Allowed To Drive ? </h2>

<br>
<br>

<p> I prefer that the driving age should not increased because I have already given a lot of reasons for that and there are many more reasons that say that the driving age should not be increased. One of the reasons why I think this, is that teenagers have a right to drive and that right will be taken away from them if the driving age is increased.
